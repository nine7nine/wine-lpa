# wine-lpa

Backup for wine-lpa patchwork and archlinuxpkgbuild (and some unused (or borked) patches, not to be applied).

Wine is currently (at the time of this writing) at version 1.9.18 and wine-staging has integrated wine-rt and has a form of shared memory in wineserver, so must people would probably tend to use it.

I found that I'm still getting better performance out of this version of wine / my setup (even with the odd bug to wrk around). I will likely try and take some time to clean up patches, remove cruft and re-base it on a newer versions of Wine (some important patches don't apply currently over the the latest development releases). That being said; This is mostly just a reference for an old build/sources.
