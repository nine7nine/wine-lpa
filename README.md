# wine-lpa

Backup for wine-lpa patchwork and archlinux pkgbuilds (and some unused (or borked) patches, not to be applied).

Wine is currently (at the time of this writing) at version 1.9.18 and wine-staging has integrated wine-rt and has a form of shared memory in wineserver, so must people would probably tend to use it.

I found that I prefer this version of Wine / my setup (even with the odd bug to wrok around). I will likely try and take some time to clean up patches, remove cruft and re-base it on a newer versions of Wine (some important patches don't apply currently over the the latest development releases).

I also tend to experiment and do lots of one-off hacks to work around problems that I encounter or improve Wine for my own use, but feel free to do what you will. lol.
