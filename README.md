# wine-lpa

Backup for wine-lpa-1.7.41 sources/pkgbuild (and some unused (or borked) patches, not to be applied).

Wine is currently (at the time of this wiriting) at version 1.9.18 and wine-staging has integrated wine-rt and has a form of shared memory in wineserver, so must people would probably tend to use it.

I personally found that I'm still getting better performance out of this version of wine, even with the odd bug, I think I prefer it. Maybe I will take some time to clean up patches, remove cruft and re-base it on a newer version of Wine. That being said; This is mostly just a reference for an old build/sources.
